Privacy Policy
===

Thank you for using **Scap**! We highly value your privacy. This document explains how we handle your data when you use this app.

## Information Collection

**Scap** is a professional macOS application tailored for capturing, annotating, and exporting images. It provides a focused editing canvas with drawing tools, blur/mosaic, spotlight, QR overlays, watermarking, and image-layer pasting. The app supports editing existing images, a free drawing board mode, and a screenshot mode with area capture and crosshair guidance. All operations are performed locally on your device.

**Please Note:** This application is designed for image editing and annotation purposes. Please use the tools responsibly and respect copyright when editing and sharing images.

**Important Note:** Scap operates completely offline. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app does not connect to remote servers or integrate any third-party services.

### a. Local Data Processing

* All settings and operations are stored only on your local device.
* The app does not record your usage behavior or upload any data.

### b. No Logging

Scap does not generate or send any logs. All operations and configurations are performed locally, with no remote communication involved.

## Use of Data

Since Scap does not collect or store any user data, there is no use or sharing of data. All of your usage remains private and offline.

## Third-Party Services

Scap does not use any third-party analytics tools, advertising platforms, or cloud services, nor does it share or sell user information to any third party.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally and the app does not communicate externally, all your settings and usage information are protected by the security mechanisms of macOS.

## User Control

* You may delete all Scap data and settings at any time.
* When you uninstall the app, all related data will be permanently removed from your device.
* The app does not perform any cloud backups — all data is fully under your control.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If there are significant changes, we will notify you through the app or official channels. Please check this page periodically to stay informed of any updates.
